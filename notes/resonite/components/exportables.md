# Exportable Components

Components that signal an asset can be exported by a user.

## Concept

- `*Exportable` components mark a slot/asset as exportable to local files.
- There are multiple variants by asset type; this is not audio-specific.

## Known Exportable types (FrooxEngine.dll)

- `FrooxEngine.AudioExportable`
- `FrooxEngine.BinaryExportable`
- `FrooxEngine.GaussianSplatExportable`
- `FrooxEngine.ModelExportable`
- `FrooxEngine.PackageExportable`

- `FrooxEngine.TextureExportable`
- `FrooxEngine.VideoExportable`
