# Interaction Modes (Physical vs Remote)

Terminology used by interaction components (for example `Grabbable`, buttons).

## Definitions

- **Physical**: direct hand or finger interaction (grabbing, pressing).
- **Remote**: laser-based interaction from the hand when the object is out of
  reach.

## Notes

- Many interaction components expose flags or settings labeled "Remote" to
  control laser interactions.
- Physical interactions require proximity/contact, while Remote interactions
  rely on the hand laser.
